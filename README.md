## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- Mobile-first workflow



### Continued development

I used Html CSS to build the responsive product page and I started by making a container for the elements and then the card and designed it for the desktop then I used Media Query to be responsive to smartphones.
